Helping Hands Against Covid-19

With social distancing in most of the world, communities and personal feelings of connection felt lost. Under quarantine orders, the already overworked middle class was unable to work.
Amidst all the chaos, particular groups of individuals face higher risks and stakes associated with a potential contraction of COVID-19 and thus  must take extra precautions to limit exposure.
Among these groups include adults 65 and older, individuals with respiratory diseases, those with diabetes, and more.
This project aims to match volunteers with people at higher risk for severe illness due to COVID-19 in order to fulfill basic services such as grocery delivery and tutoring.
